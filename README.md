Repo used to keep track of latest PCB design and access shared circuit schematics

Project Name: Micromouse power module 

Team members: May Yuan-Klitzner (YNKMAY001) and Colby Skirving (SKRCOL001)

Description of project: Tasked to design and manufacture the power module for the micromouse, the power board will be designed using Kicad. This repo will be used to upload and download the latest power board design in order to keep track of any changes made and both be able to edit the most recent design.

Folder structure: The repo consists of three folders, the first contains the circuit schematics, the second contains the circuit schematics with added comments and the third contains the PCB design.
